Look at the [hexo-input.md](./examples/hexo-input.md) file as an example as Hexo blog post to convert and use the [2018-06-19-jekyll-output.md](./examples/2018-06-19-jekyll-output.md) as the target format to convert to.

Also rename the file and prefix the source file name with the date metadata which is in the head of the markdown file. Looking at [hexo-input.md](./examples/hexo-input.md) as an example and the value date: 2018-06-19 08:27:56, this would be prefixed to the file and called '2018-06-19-hexo-input.md'.
