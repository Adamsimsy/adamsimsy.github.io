Just reviewed and started using this module after being frustrated with abstractions and getting buried in wrappers. No matter how good you are at managing your solution, you'll end up with a mess of wrappers to be able to unit test every facet of Sitecore.

<!-- more -->

Purist might not agree with the approach but for me it enables you to unit test wha is important, the logic and behaviours of the code you write that uses the Sitecore API.

Nice work!
