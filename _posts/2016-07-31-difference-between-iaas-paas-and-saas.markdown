Over the last few years working as an SA i've helped to architect solutions that use more and more cloud services and very often see the following terms used:

- **IaaS** or *Infrastrcture as a Service*
- **PaaS** or *Platform as a Service*
- **SaaS** or *Software as a Service*

Just from looking at the names of each service types, most technical people can work out what is provided by each. But unfortunately sometimes people are unsure of the differences, paticularly where IaaS ends and PaaS starts.

So i thought i'd put together a simple illustration which may help someone looking for a quick overview of the differences.

IaaS | PaaS | SaaS
-----|------|-----
Applications | Applications | *Applications*
Data | Data | Data
Runtime | *Runtime* | Runtime
Middleware | Middleware | Middleware
O/S | O/S | O/S
*Virtualisation* | Virtualisation | Virtualisation
Servers | Servers | Servers
Storage | Storage | Storage
Networking | Networking | Networking

* Managed by vendor
